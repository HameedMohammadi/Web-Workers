Web Worker Example
This project demonstrates the usage of Web Workers in a web application to perform heavy computational tasks in the background, thereby enhancing performance and responsiveness.

Instructions for Running the Project Locally:
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/HameedMohammadi/Web-workers.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Web-workers
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

Click on the buttons to trigger different actions:

Sort with Web Worker: Sorts a large array of random numbers using a Web Worker.
Sort without Web Worker: Sorts the same array directly in the main thread.
Change Output Color: Changes the background color of the output area.
Summary of Findings:
Using Web Workers for heavy computational tasks, such as sorting large arrays, significantly improves the performance and responsiveness of the web application. By offloading these tasks to background threads, the main UI thread remains responsive, ensuring a smoother user experience.

Challenges Faced:
While implementing this project, some challenges were encountered, including:

Setting up and configuring Web Workers to communicate with the main thread.
Managing data transfer between the main thread and Web Workers efficiently.
Ensuring compatibility across different web browsers.
